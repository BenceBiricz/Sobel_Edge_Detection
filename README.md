# Sobel edge detection with threads

The program:
1. The Sobel edge detection program developed in C# is a powerful image processing tool used to identify edges within images or video frames.
2. Utilizing the Sobel operator, this program convolves the image with two filters, one for detecting vertical edges and another for horizontal edges, enhancing the edges' contrast.
3. By calculating the gradient magnitude from the combined horizontal and vertical gradients, the program highlights areas of rapid intensity changes, revealing edges and contours in the image.
4. This C# program employs techniques like nested loops and pixel manipulation to efficiently apply the Sobel operator to each pixel, producing an output image where edges are prominently displayed.
5. The Sobel edge detection program finds applications in various fields, including computer vision, medical imaging, and object recognition, providing a fundamental step in preprocessing images for further analysis or feature extraction.
